# Hybrid Music Recommendation System

This project is a hybrid music recommendation system that combines Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Emotion-Based Recommendations**: Generates recommendations based on musical emotion labels such as 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Calm', etc.
- **Hybrid Model**: Utilizes CBF to generate initial recommendations based on a user's listening history and then refines these results using CF to provide a final recommendation list.
- **2-Step Execution**: Enhances efficiency by separating the process into a model training/caching step (`build`) and a recommendation step (`recommend`).

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the Project**
    ```bash
    # git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd music_recommender_final
    ```

2.  **Unzip the Dataset**
    The dataset is stored in a zip file (`data/dataset.zip`). After cloning the repository, you must unzip this file so that the required `.csv` files are placed directly inside the `data/` directory.

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them at once using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ▶️ How to Use

This project runs in two modes: **`build`** and **`recommend`**.

### Step 1: Build Model & Cache (`build` mode)

Before generating recommendations, you need to train the CBF model and pre-calculate initial recommendations to create a cache. This process is time-consuming and should be run once initially or whenever the training data changes.

```bash
python main.py --mode build
```

Once execution is complete, a CBF recommendation file will be created in the `output/cbf_intermediate/` directory.

### Step 2: Get Recommendations for a Specific User (`recommend` mode)

After the `build` step is complete, you can quickly get personalized recommendations for a specific user by providing their ID and an emotion label.

-   `--user`: The ID of the user to receive recommendations.
-   `--emotion`: The emotion label for the recommendation (e.g., `Happy`, `Sad`, `Angry`, `Calm`, `Romantic`, `Energetic`).
-   `--top_k`: The number of tracks to recommend (default: 30).

**Example:**
To get the top 20 recommendations for user `1` based on the `Happy` emotion:

```bash
python main.py --mode recommend --user 1 --emotion Happy --top_k 20
```

**Output:**
The recommendation result will be saved as a `.csv` file in the `output/final_recommendations/` directory, with a name like `cf_rec_user_1_Happy_... .csv`.
